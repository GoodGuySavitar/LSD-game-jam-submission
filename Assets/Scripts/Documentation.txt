This Document is to write some stuff for the code that is written, so it can be understood better.
Describe features implemented and how, so that it wont be confused later.

When dealing with a Scene, Make a copy if it, and add your Name with Testing. We can transfer stuff later,
That way, we dont have conflicts with the git.

    Format:
    - Use any name followed by () to refer to a feature, use a "-" as points under that 
    - Any features that you feel is under another, put it under them with a tab.
